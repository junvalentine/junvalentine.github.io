So this is my first blog, and I decide to write about my first day at VNG Corp. I felt so lucky and thankful that I had a chance to be an intern at the first Vietnamese tech 'unicorn', even though I was only a second-year undergraduate! There are also two friends of mine in [BKISC club](http://bkisc.com) joining VNG as interns.


## What I do on my first day
In the morning, all I had to do was submit and sign all the relevant documents, just as other companies would let me do. Then we listened to a HR giving a roughly introduction of VNG, which took about an hour (the company is too big to give a short intro, i guess :D).  


The next part is receiving devices for working, and i got a Macbook. Actually, I wouldn't have it, but my mentors said that he mistakenly told the IT helpdesk to give me a macbook , so lucky! Anyway, after a few tries, I began to prefer using the Macbook to my old "boiling" MSI; once again, thanks to my mentor!


Me and my friends had lunch together with my mentor and his colleague in the VNG's canteen. The food here is so so good (much better than what I eat every day :D). As people always say, 'life is not like a dream', I got my first embarrassment at work. After lunch, I thought that I would have a little nap before working in the afternoon, but my mentor immediately called us to the meeting room and gave us a two-hour talk on what we will do, and I yawned like 5 or 6 times during the talk :D. This is when I learned that many people here work from morning till dawn without napping. Guess I will have to adapt quickly to this habit.


## Feeling
Never before in my life have I written something about my experience or feelings and made it public like this blog. For more than a year now, I have achieved so much that I never think of it. So to have something to read when I am 40–50, I decided to write this, also marking the start of my blog. I hope that I still have things to say and the motivation to write more in the future!
