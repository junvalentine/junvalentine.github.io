I'm writing this post to look back on all the trips I've taken and the countries I've visited in 2023. This year I've been to 3 different countries, including Korea, The US and Italy. All these trips are for CTFs and I really enjoyed it (actually I don't care much about the CTFs, I just want to meet people there and travelling around the cities xD).

## Sejong, Korea - Hacktheon Sejong 

The CTF was not really good, there's only one crypto challenge and I solved it in the first 5 minutes of the CTF (lol!). 

But who care about the CTF? This is my most enjoyable trip. The weather is really nice, so nice that me and my friends had a really good sleep, woke up late and missed the bus to the ceremony after the CTFs. Luckily, we managed to get there in time xD.

In the photo above, me and my friend Hacao, were trying to light the fire for a BBQ party but failed miserably . We then had to eat noodles TvT.

This pic was taken when I was going from the Incheon Airport to Sejong City. Just posting it here because I think it's the most impressive picture I've taken xD

## San Diego, The United States - International Cybersecurity Championship 2023

I learned a lot through this trip!!!. Met a lot of 'god' tier players there (everyone is god except me TvT). The CTFs was divided into 2 days with two different games on each day: Jeopardy and Attack Defense. The Jeopardy challenges were really bad, hope the organizers will improve the challenge's quality next year. However, I really enjoyed the Attack Defense and learned a lot from my teammates. I was a bit sad that team Asia couldn't win the ICC, but I have a strong belief that Team Asia will won ICC 2024!!

_Going to the park, right?_

In the photo above, my teammate Mechfrog was leading us to a well-known park, but his path was really weird. We all doubted if he was taking us to the park or to Mexico, considering Mexico is next to San Diego, lol.

## Turin, Italy - Molecon CTF Final 2023

This was my final trip of the year 2023. I attended the Molecon as a Crypto player for thehackerscrew. The CTF was really nice, but unfortunately we only got fifth place although we were second before the scoreboard froze.

There were some 'twists' in my trip to Italy. Firstly, I had planned to go to Milan with my friend before leaving Italy, but he changed his plans, leaving me alone in Milan. Secondly, my flight got CANCELLED due to heavy snowfall in Munich, and the airport was shut down. Luckily, Lufthansa provided me with another flight to Paris, so I could then return to Vietnam, yay!.

I regreted not buying a Switch when i got to the Singapore airport. Initially my return flight had Singapore as one of the destinations, but then my flight was cancelled and I had to fly from Milan to Paris and to Vietnam TvT.

It began to snow as my flight took off from Munich to Turin. I heard that a member of the other teams got stuck in Munich for 2, 3 days and had to play the Molecon online. So sad.

Macarone was so so good, the best food I had in the whole trip.

### Some of the photos in Turin

The most regrettable thing for me is that I forgot Juventus Football Club is located in Turin, and I missed the trip to the stadium. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?

### Some of the photos in Milan

After Turin, I took a train to Milan and traveled around for 2 days. It was really fun, especially the trip to San Siro â€“ my first time being to a stadium of a big club (could have been the Juventus Stadium TvT).

## Sum up

Besides the three trips mentioned above, I also had a memorable trip to Da Nang City for the ISITDTU Finals, but it would take me more time to post additional pictures here (I'm feeling a bit lazy now). Throughout these trips, my sticker collection kept getting larger and larger, hehe.

_CTF stickers collection_

In 2024, I will be focused on my graduation capstone project, therefore I may not be able to travel as much as I did in 2023. However, I still hope to have as much fun as I did in the previous year.
