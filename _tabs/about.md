## Background

My name is Onirique, but you may also know me as Junvalentine. 

I'm currently playing CTF for [thehackerscrew](https://twitter.com/thehackerscrew1) and [cr3.mov](https://twitter.com/cr3mov), mainly focus in crypto challenges. I'm also the president of [BKISC](https://bkisc.com) (Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology Information Security Club).

I'm a Man United fan and a Hanni simper. I can speak some Japanese (I'm a wibu ofc).
